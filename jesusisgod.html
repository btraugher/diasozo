        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The teaching of the bible is that God is triune in nature, or a trinity. The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit are all God. They are coequal, coeternal and of one essence.</p>
        <p>One of the most common heretical beliefs you may find amongst all cult groups and false religions is the denial of the divinity of Christ. Here is a brief list of those groups who deny Christ's godhood:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muslims</li>
            <li>Jehovah's Witnesses</li>
            <li>Unitarians</li>
            <li>Mormons</li>
            <li>Oneness Pentecostals</li>
            <li>Christian Science</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this article you will see an extensive list of Bible verses that are commonly used to challenge the divinity of Jesus. Many of these verses have been memorized by some of the above groups and catch alot of believers off-guard. Muslims are trained by their Imams to open straight up to verses like John 17:3, Mark 13:32, and&nbsp;Deuteronomy 6:4. While each of these verses could have an article of their own due to depth of arguments, the purpose of this article is to give quick solid responses to common objections. My hope is that Christians no longer fall victim to verses being taken out of context, and are able to defend the faith against those who believe in false doctrine.</p>
        
        <h2>Refutations</h2>

        <div class="verse-container">
            <div class="verse-header">
                <strong>Deuteronomy 6:4 (KJV):</strong> "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:"
            </div>
            <div class="exposition-content">
                <p>One of the most famous verses used by anti-trinitarians. The claim is that "...God is one..." means that God cannot be "three" as in the Trinity. We will use it to demostrate the reality of the trinity instead using Hebrew and by using exposition from Genesis.</p>

                </section>
                
                <p>The same word "echad" is used in Genesis 2:24 where God says "...and they shall be one flesh." in reference to the union of Adam and Eve. The same Hebrew word used to describe collective union is being used to describe God. This disproves the claim that God is one person, but rather shows that God is one in essence and in nature, with three distinct persons.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Add to this the fact the Hebrew identifies God three times and then declares that God is one, and you have a quick and easy refutation to the anti-trinitarian claim. The Hebrew insinuates that God has a triune nature.</p>
                <p>This response is the exact same for Mark 12:29</p>

        <div class="verse-container">
            <div class="verse-header">
                <strong>Proverbs 8:22-23 (KJV):</strong> "The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was."
            </div>
            <div class="exposition-content">
                <p>Many interpret the personification of wisdom in Proverbs, specifically chapter eight, to be a reference to the person of Christ. This is due to the description of wisdom's role in creation, and Jesus being called the wisdom of God in&nbsp;1 Cor 1:24,30.</p>
                <p>Some translations, specifically the New World Translation used by Jehovah's witnesses say that God "produced" or "created" wisdom in verse 22, rather than posessed. Leading to the claim that Jesus was created. Let's examine the Hebrew word here.</p>
                <h2>קָנָנִי - Qanah</h2>
                <p>From Blue Letter Bible:<br /><br />"The KJV translates Strong's H7069 [qanah] in the following manner: Buy (46x), get (15x), purchased (5x), buyer (3x), possessor (3x), possessed (2x), owner (1x), recover (1x), redeemed (1x), miscellaneous (7x)."</p>
                <p>The only relevant verses among the seven miscellaneous translations are the following:</p>
                <p><strong>Genesis 14:19:</strong> "And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor (qanah) of heaven and earth:"<br /><strong>Genesis 14:22:</strong> "And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor (qanah) of heaven and earth,"<br /><strong>Deuteronomy 32:6:</strong> "Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought (qanah) thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?"<br /><strong>Psalm 139:13:</strong> "For thou hast possessed (qanah) my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb."</p>
                <p>As we can see, to use the word&nbsp;<em>qanah</em> to describe having been created is not an honest use of the word. It is not the word normally used to describe an act of creation, but rather posessed or purchased. This would also insinuate that God had to create wisdom, and had no wisdom prior to its creation.</p>
                <p>Additionally Christians are not bound to hold to the interpretation that Christ is the wisdom of Proverbs. A similar personification of foolishness is found in Proverbs 9, and nobody believes foolishness to be an actual person.</p>
