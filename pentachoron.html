            <p>The second chapter of James has been a stumbling block to many who believe in the free gift of salvation. Many people have a difficult time reconciling their free grace theology with this chapter, and many Catholics believe it to be the kryptonite of the protestant who believes in salvation by faith alone. In this article, you will learn that your works do not save you and are not required for your salvation, and that James and Paul complement each other perfectly. We will demonstrate this using Romans Chapter 4. Both of these passages discuss the nature of Abraham's justification in Genesis Chapter 22.</p>

                James 2:24 (KJV): "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
