            <p>The second chapter of James has been a stumbling block to many who believe in the free gift of salvation. Many people have a difficult time reconciling their free grace theology with this chapter, and many Catholics believe it to be the kryptonite of the protestant who believes in salvation by faith alone. In this article, you will learn that your works do not save you and are not required for your salvation, and that James and Paul complement each other perfectly. We will demonstrate this using Romans Chapter 4. Both of these passages discuss the nature of Abraham's justification in Genesis Chapter 22.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:14 (KJV): "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
            </div>
            
            <p>The discourse closes with the following verse:</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:24 (KJV): "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
            </div>
            
            <p>When reading these verses completely out of context, it could easily be misinterpreted. We aren't going to be reading them out of context, so let's discuss what happens between them. It is critically important to rightly divide the word and bring in the full context of what the Holy Spirit is trying to teach us. No longer will you be stumped when someone says, "the only place that faith alone is mentioned in the Bible is when it says you are NOT justified by faith alone." This is called a word-concept fallacy and is the same thing as trying to disprove the trinity because the word "trinity" is not found in the Bible.</p>
            
            <p>The initial question asked is about the profitability of faith with no works. Going into this passage we need to keep in mind that James is asking us what it profits, nowhere does this passage claim that works are required for salvation. He then asks if faith can save. An important distinction here is that we are saved by grace through faith. Faith in and of itself is not what saves us. It is the grace of God which saves, and that is accessed by faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:17 (KJV): "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:20 (KJV): "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
            </div>
            
            <p>A dead faith is still faith, though it may not be profitable. Many are unwilling to state this plainly. The word of God gives a clear picture of grace. It remains untouched, and cannot be altered, or intermixed with works.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                Romans 11:6 (KJV): And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
            </div>
            
            <p>If even a single work is required to obtain grace, then it is no longer grace. This is a hard fact of scripture.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:18 (KJV): "Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
            </div>
            
            <p>This verse highlights where the works really start to come into focus. Nowhere does James say that these works prove our faith to God. This "display of works" that the author talks about is shown by and to men only. Let's refer to Romans 4.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                Romans 4:2 (KJV): "For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God."
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:21 (KJV): "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
            </div>
            
            <p>If Abraham were justified by works, he would be justified before men, not before God. The point is that works will demonstrate your trustworthiness, reliability, and devotion to other men on earth. It can be a gauge that will allow others to know what may lie in your heart, but only God knows what's truly in your heart. God only looks for the faith in order to give access to grace. Your faith may bear more fruit than others, but this does not make you any more saved than them.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="section">
            <p>The following verse is commonly used to argue against justification and salvation by faith alone:</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:19 (KJV): "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
            </div>
            
            <p>The argument you will commonly hear is that you can't "just believe" because "even Satan believes", you have to be surrendered. Not only does this muddy the issue of being saved by grace and not of works, but it grossly misinterprets the passage. What is it that you can't "just believe" and still be saved? The answer is you cannot just believe that there is one God. People who believe in the doctrine of salvation by faith alone agree you cannot be saved by simply believing in one God. Muslims and Jews believe there is "one God", but they do not meet the prerequisites to be saved. The requirement is believing in Jesus Christ, the eternally begotten Son of God. That's the difference.</p>
            
            <p>Jesus did not come to this world and die on the cross to save demons. His plan for salvation involves mankind, not Satan. So don't let this verse shake you. The Devil cannot and will never be saved, because Jesus did not die for him. The good news is that Jesus died for YOU! Rest in this truth and rejoice!</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                Romans 4:3 (KJV): "For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                James 2:23 (KJV): "And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
            </div>
            
            <p>Contrary to what the mistaken preacher wants you to believe, Paul tells us that the correct kind of belief is enough to be made righteous in the sight of God. I reiterate, it does not say that Abraham "believed and did works and it was counted as righteousness". James and Paul are in perfect agreement here. Any tension between their writings is due to the different perspective that James is offering. He is emphasizing that we should be doers of the word, and not only hearers (James 1:22). Paul's emphasis is strictly salvation in this case.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                Romans 4:4-5 (KJV): "Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
            </div>
            
            <p>The two verses in Romans paint a clear picture: He who does nothing but has faith is saved, and he who does everything with no faith is not saved. Jesus says this himself in the parable of the tax collector and the Pharisee.</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                Luke 18:11-14 (KJV): "The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

        <section class="conclusion">
            <p>In closing, I want to emphasize that scripture does not contradict. When people say that James is arguing against faith alone, they are saying that scripture is not consistent. I want to emphasize that Jesus and the apostles were not lying when they said the following:</p>
            
            <div class="verse">
                John 3:16 (KJV): "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

            <div class="verse">
                John 6:47 (KJV): "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."

            <div class="verse">
                Acts 16:31 (KJV): "And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                John 11:25-26 (KJV): "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"
            </div>
            
            <div class="verse">
                John 20:31 (KJV): "But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name."

            <div class="verse">
                Acts 10:43 (KJV): "To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
